This repository contains my individual contribution to the team project **Duck Game**, developed using **C++** and **SFML**.

## 🚀 About My Contribution

I designed and implemented a custom game level called **Space Map**, which simulates a realistic space environment to enhance the gameplay experience.

### Key Features of the Space Map:
- 🌕 **Moon-like ground sections** that serve as platforms for the player to jump on  
- 🌌 A visually immersive **space-themed background**  
- 🎵 A dedicated **space-themed soundtrack** to set the mood  
- ⚖️ A unique **low-gravity system** that mimics the reduced gravity of outer space, adding a fresh and challenging gameplay mechanic  

## 🛠️ What I Worked On
- Designing the overall layout and structure of the Space Map  
- Creating and placing the moon surface sprites and other visual assets  
- Integrating the space background and theme music  
- Implementing collision detection between the player and the map environment  
- Applying the special gravity mechanic to simulate space physics  

> **Note:** My work did not include player movement or core game mechanics — my focus was strictly on the map design, atmosphere, and interaction mechanics.

## 🎮 About the Project
